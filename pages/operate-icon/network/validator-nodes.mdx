From the glossary, a [Validator node](https://icon.community/glossary/validator-node/) is defined as follows:

> Block validator for the ICON network. Transaction processors for operations that change the state of the ICON network. Typically representing an end-user group that has made important contributions to the ICON network. Typically encouraged to incentivize the at-large ICON Community for participation and to help increase the value of the ICON network

Validator nodes write to the ICON blockchain. They do this by [processing transactions](/develop-on-icon-chain/icon-execution-environments) on individual nodes and then [forming a consensus](/develop-on-icon-chain/blockchain-components/consensus-mechanism) with other nodes.

It is not possible to access a Validator node publicly. This serves to reduce the amount of work that a Validator node must do, which allows them to operate faster and more accurately. All public access to ICON occurs through an [API Endpoint](/operate-icon/network/api-endpoints).

### Why run a Validator node?

Running a Validator node increases diversity within the ICON network. Diversity lowers the chances of a network attack through a malicious user. Running a Validator node also increases your value to the community, because you are now opening yourself as a possible [Delegate](/operate-icon/governance/delegates), which means that you would take on part of the responsibility of ensuring that the network operates properly.
