# Network proposals

A _network proposal_ is a mechanism for governance where [Delegates](/concepts/governance/delegates) can submit ideas for changes that they would like to see implemented in the ICON Network. These ideas are recorded and voted upon _on-chain_, which means that the proposal document and the voting results can be seen publicly by all.&#x20;

The following section will describe network proposals in details, show the different types of network proposals and how to register and vote on them:
